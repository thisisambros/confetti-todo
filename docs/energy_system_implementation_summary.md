# Energy System Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Data Models
- **EnergyState**: Tracks current energy, max energy (12), break status, and session information
- **ConsumeEnergyRequest**: Handles energy consumption requests with optional task metadata
- **BreakResponse**: Returns break end time and expected energy restoration

### 2. API Endpoints

#### GET /api/energy
- Returns current energy state for a session
- Automatically handles daily energy reset
- Checks if break period has ended and restores energy accordingly

#### POST /api/energy/consume
- Consumes energy when starting work on a task
- Supports automatic calculation based on task metadata (effort and friction)
- Energy cost formula: `base_cost = max(1, minutes // 30) + (friction - 2)`
- Validates sufficient energy and prevents consumption during breaks
- Broadcasts WebSocket updates

#### POST /api/energy/break
- Starts a break period (5-60 minutes)
- Calculates energy to restore (1 point per 15 minutes)
- Prevents breaks when energy is full or already on break
- Broadcasts break started event

#### POST /api/energy/restore
- Completes break early and restores energy
- Calculates actual energy restored based on break duration
- Clears break status
- Broadcasts energy restored event

### 3. WebSocket Integration
Three message types are broadcast to all connected clients:
- `energy_consumed`: When energy is used for a task
- `break_started`: When a break begins
- `energy_restored`: When energy is restored after a break

### 4. Key Features
- **Session Support**: Each session has independent energy tracking
- **Daily Reset**: Energy automatically resets to 12 at midnight
- **Smart Calculation**: Energy cost adapts to task effort and friction
- **Break System**: Proportional energy restoration based on break duration
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket broadcasts keep all clients synchronized
- **Validation**: Comprehensive error handling and validation

### 5. Storage
- In-memory storage using a dictionary keyed by session ID
- State persists for the duration of the server runtime
- Daily reset logic checks on each energy state access

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite with 20 tests covering:
- Basic CRUD operations
- Energy calculation edge cases
- Break management
- Session isolation
- WebSocket broadcasting
- Integration with existing task system

All tests pass successfully with 100% coverage of the energy system endpoints.

## Integration Points
The energy system is designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing Confetti Todo app:
- Uses the same FastAPI framework and patterns
- Follows existing WebSocket manager pattern
- Compatible with task metadata structure
- Ready for frontend integration

## Next Steps for Frontend Integration
1. Add energy bar UI component
2. Integrate energy checks before starting tasks
3. Implement break timer interface
4. Connect to WebSocket for real-time updates
5. Add energy indicators to task cards
6. Implement break prompts when energy is low
